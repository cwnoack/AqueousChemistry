This repository contains document artifacts for an inforamtion exchange for Aqueous Chemistry. The artifacts include an Excel Workbook that defines and documents the content model, and an XML schema that implements the model.

Several 'suites' of analytes representing common analysis results are defined, with the intention that an implementation of the content model would offer several observation feature types, each of which consists of the header fields combined with the analytes for a suite. A content type for reporting results for a single analyte is also proposed, with an abbreviated header; this could be implemented for services similar to the EPA storet data services. In this approach a single analysis result is delivered as a collection of observation records, each with the same AnalysisURI and reporting single analyte. AqueousChemicalAnalysis-BasicData contains fields for information used to discover and retrieve chemical analyses meeting various criteria, and to evaluate the reported results. These fields would be reported along with a collection of analytes from the different suites proposed on the suites table. 

Previously deployed services used version 1.9, which separated Well and Spring chemical analyses. The new version 1.10 combines these observations into one service. This 1.10 version should be used in future AqChem services.  2013-03-07
